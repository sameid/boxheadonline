We are Roadhouse Studios.  
<br>	The name had arised one morning in Grade 11 Computer Science.
<br>	My friend jiboojiboo (also a developer) and myself (The lazy kill) had been saying "roadhouse" in reference to the popular show which will remain unamed.
<br>	When it came time to hand in our final ISU, what better name to choose than "Roadhouse Studios".
<br>	As time went on developers have come and gone from the Roadhouse Studios label.
<br>	But my close friend Fire and myself The lazy kill, are back and pursing the private development of our projects.
<br>	Boxhead Online was our biggest accomplishment, but we intend to make it even better!

<br>February 20th, 2011 - Big Update Fail!
</font>
<br>___________________________________________________________________________
<br>So everyone knows I promised a big secretive update with all new features, but failed to deliver.
<br>It seems though as my studies have got in the way. But don't worry the update will own the last build!
<br>Fire and me are trying to get things just perfect.
<br>Also the online gameplay is peer to peer. Which means users must open certain ports if they are connected to a router.
<br>But no need to worry, a simplified guide will be on the website on the time of release.
<br>Right now only individuals that are developing are Fire and myself.
<br>So I have decided to bring a few more people under the Roadhouse Studios label.
<br>Maybe we can speed things up.
<br>
<br>I have decided that since I was not able to deliver the update atleast I can inform you of the features to come.
<br> - - Facebook Website Intergration (Hopefully)
<br> - - Friend messenging system
<br> - - Quicker intial load times (Probably an intial install the first load, after that the load will be quick.)
<br> - - Big game improvements (Props to Fire/BEAST PROGRAMER, these will stay hidden until update)
<br> - - LIVE Connection to Roadhouse Servers
<br> - - - Enables Status Updates (What are your friends up to...)
<br> - - - UI Speed Improvements
<br> - - - Just an overall less stale online UI.
<br> - - - Updates and News
<br> - - Online Multiplayer Support (More than two players, Deathmatch maybe?)
<br> - - Because there are more developers, we are going to put up their games as well. (Big games....)
<br>
<br>ETA on the update is difficult right now. I hope to get the update out by early March. Keep testing, Keep playing, Keep pwning.
